        Anthony Padgett's new book <font color="blue"><b>Seven Science Questions And Why They Matter</b></font>
        takes a beneath the surface look at what is being presented to today's students in the name of 'science'. It is a straightforward, easy to comprehend walk-through of today's relevant science questions such as:
        <br>• Does faith in God really cause brain damage and hinder the advancement of scientific thinking?
        <br>• Could life really have spontaneously generated from non-life?
        <br>• How much of Darwinian evolution is based on real science?
        <br>• Can the Big Bang theory really account for the origin of the universe?
        <br>• Is man's use of flourocarbons causing the demise of planet earth?
        <br>• Where did '4.6 billion years' come from, and how old is the earth really?
        <br>... and many more!
        <br>Interested in the real story behind the psuedo science being presented in today's classrooms and the media?  Then this book is for you!
        <br><br>
        Parents, this book is a <b>MUST READ</b> for students entering high school or college. The information presented will ensure that your student
        is not de-converted in their Biology class and it will give them a solid foundation so that they can not only resist pseudo-science based 
        attacks on their worldview, but also enable them go on the offensive helping others to understand that embracing faith is a solid, 
        intellectually sound position that does NOT mean rejecting sound science.  Almost without exception, every parent that I have shared 
        the details of Seven Science Questions with wants their children to read this book and has asked how they can obtain a copy.

                    <li>
                        Soft tissues such as blood vessels and genetic material cannot survive in exposed fossils for longer than
                        10,000 years, yet they have been found intact in dinosaur and wooly mammoth fossils?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                         Roughly 73% of the salt entering the earth's oceans remains in the oceans? Ocean salinity slowly increases
                        time yet it salinity levels have still remained below levels that would destroy all marine life.  This strongly
                        indicates young oceans that cannot be more than several thousand years old!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The earth would cool from molten rock to its current temperature in less than 30,000 years? If the solar system was
                        more than about 100,000 years old, all planets and moons in our solar system should have lost all their heat and
                        become cold and dead, yet today they still have very hot cores and are alive with geologic activity. This is strong
                        evidence for a much younger solar system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Throughout modern history the earth's surface temparature has been known to fluctuate in cyclical fashion.  Throughout
                        history there has been as much concern about global cooling (and the dawn of a new ice age) as there has been about global
                        warming?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is no such thing as a 'simple' cell? The smallest element of the simplest cells has been found to far
                        excel in every sense any innovation produced by the intelligence of man?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The information storage capacity of DNA is staggering? DNA stores quantities of coded information equaling
                        one million 4 Terabyte hard drives in a space smaller that the head of a pin (yes, you read that right)!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All life forms are driven by extremely complex information storage and processing systems? Yet no information system
                        has ever formed by random chance without an intelligent programmer, nor is it possible that even the simplest
                        information system ever could!
